# aacini
Data summarization tools and scripts for Biolymph deliveries from SciLifeLab

## Setting up a Python virtual environment
We use conda to create the virtual environment and manage project dependencies in isolation, but feel free to use any other similar tool. Run the following commands in the repository folder (where requirements.txt is located) to create a conda environment with the required packages.

Create a conda environment with Python 3.7 and pip:

`conda create -n aacini python=3.10 pip`

Activate the conda environment:

`conda activate mul-emo-recog`

Install the required packages from requirements.txt:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
